# ObjectRecognition-using-OpenCV-and-YOLO
<h2>An object detection model with a pretrained dataset</h2>
<h3>Made an object recognition model using OpenCV and YOLO for optimum performance.</h3><br>
i)It uses YOLO because it is much more efficient with low end PC's and thus providing optimum output.<br>
ii) We can also train this with some custom dataset to recognize people with their faces.<br>
iii) This same model was also used in an attendance marking project, where it just uses face to mark people's attendance.<br>
